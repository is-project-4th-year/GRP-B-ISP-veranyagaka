# SRCNN: Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network

This project implements an **SRCNN (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network)** to enhance low-resolution images by reconstructing high-resolution details. The model is based on the seminal paper *"Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks"* by Dong et al.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Implementation of a basic SRCNN model using deep learning.
- Trains on low-resolution and high-resolution image pairs.
- Evaluates results using metrics such as **PSNR** and **SSIM**.
- Supports inference on custom input images.
